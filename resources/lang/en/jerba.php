    'p2' => 'The terrain of Djerba is almost completely flat. The maximum altitude on the island is only 52 meters above sea level. But one notices coastal rock formations not very far from the lighthouse of Taguermez or that of borj jillij next to Ajim.' ,
    'p3' => 'Le relief de Djerba est presque totalement plat. L’altitude maximale sur l’île n’est que de 52 mètres au-dessus du niveau de la mer. Mais on remarque des formations rocheuses côtières pas très loin du phare de Taguermez ou bien celle de borj jillij à côté d’Ajim.' ,
    'p4' => ' The possibilities of agriculture are very limited by poor soils and drought, it rains very little in Djerba (200 millimetres of rain per year).' ,

    'p13' => 'Each village has its own features. The olive tree remains the key element of agriculture in Djerba, everywhere in the island inside or along the roads we observe several hectares of olive groves, from thousand-year-old trees to trunks knotted some older than 2000 years. Sometimes the roots of the trees sink up to five meters into the ground or even more in search of water.' ,
